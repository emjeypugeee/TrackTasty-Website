            <p>
              <strong>Q:</strong> How do I create a TrackTasty account?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> On the startup page, select “Sign Up” or
              “Register.” You will be guided through creating a new account that
              you can use to log in.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Q:</strong> I forgot my password. What should I do?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> On the login page, use the “Forget Password”
              option. You will be able to reset your password after verifying
              your identity through your registered email.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Q:</strong> Why do I need to provide my personal
              information during sign-up?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> This information is essential for our system
              to accurately calculate your personalized daily calorie needs and
              macronutrient goals (carbs, fats, and protein). This ensures your
              meal plans and tracking are tailored specifically to you.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What are dietary preferences and allergies
              used for?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> Your dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian,
              keto) help our chatbot prioritise foods you enjoy when generating
              meal plans. Your allergies are used to avoid suggesting foods that
              may be harmful to you.

              Understanding Macro Tracking
            </h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What are macros and why should I track
              them?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> Macros (short for macronutrients) are
              carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Tracking them helps you
              maintain the right balance to achieve your fitness goals.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Q:</strong> How does macro tracking differ from calorie
              counting?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> Calorie counting focuses on total intake,
              while macro tracking ensures the right ratio of proteins, carbs,
              and fats for optimal health and performance.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What if I go over my macros for one day?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> Don’t worry! One day won’t ruin your progress.
              Consistency matters more than daily perfection.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Q:</strong> How long does it take to see results from
              macro tracking?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> Most people notice energy changes within 1–2
              weeks and visible progress after 4–6 weeks of consistent tracking.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Q:</strong> What’s the best way to measure food for
              accuracy?<br />
              <strong>A:</strong> Use a food scale for solids, measuring cups
              for liquids, and log everything in the app immediately after
              measuring.
